# Design Pattern Selection

## Goal

Choose patterns based on the concrete pain in the code, not from memory.

## First question

Before choosing a pattern, identify where the friction comes from:

1. Object creation
2. Object boundaries and composition
3. Behavior that changes by case, context, or state

Pick the pattern only after the pain is explicit.

## 1) Creation pain

Use when constructors/configuration are hard to read, easy to misuse, or repeated.

- `Builder`: Many parameters, valid combinations matter, creation needs early validation.
- `Factory Method`: Subclasses choose concrete types behind a shared contract.
- `Abstract Factory`: You need matching families of related objects.
- `Prototype`: Cloning a configured object is cheaper/safer than rebuilding.
- `Singleton`: Only for truly process-wide shared/stateless objects; avoid for mutable/request-scoped state.

## 2) Structure pain

Use when boundaries are leaking or composition is awkward.

- `Adapter`: Translate external interfaces into your internal contract.
- `Facade`: Hide unsafe/verbose multi-step subsystems behind one safe entry point.
- `Decorator`: Add optional behavior via composition instead of subclass explosion.
- `Proxy`: Insert lazy-loading, caching, access control, instrumentation, or remote access behind a local interface.
- `Composite`: Treat leaves and containers uniformly in hierarchical domains.
- `Bridge`: Avoid subclass matrices when two dimensions evolve independently.
- `Flyweight`: Share repeated intrinsic data when in-memory duplication is expensive.

## 3) Behavior pain

Use when conditionals multiply and behavior changes often.

- `Strategy`: Swap algorithms/policies while keeping callers stable.
- `State`: Model explicit modes/transitions instead of branching by flags.
- `Chain of Responsibility`: Middleware-style sequential handlers with stop/continue contracts.
- `Command`: Represent actions as objects for queueing, retries, undo, and auditability.
- `Observer`: One-to-many notifications; keep side effects visible and bounded.
- `Mediator`: Centralize coordination when peer-to-peer coupling gets messy.
- `Memento`: Capture and restore snapshots safely (undo/rollback).
- `Visitor`: Add new operations over a stable object structure.

## Selection Rules

- Start with the smallest pattern that removes today's recurring cost.
- Do not apply a pattern just to "improve architecture."
- Keep boundary patterns focused on translation/orchestration, not domain policy.
- If a pattern increases hidden coupling, roll back to a simpler design.
- Prefer explicit seams that improve testability and change isolation.

## Practical Signals

- Repeated branching by provider/plan/context -> consider `Strategy`.
- Repeated "which class do I instantiate?" logic -> centralize with `Factory`.
- Repeated argument-heavy construction mistakes -> `Builder`.
- External API shapes leaking across domain code -> `Adapter`.
- Multi-step workflows called inconsistently -> `Facade` or `Command`.
