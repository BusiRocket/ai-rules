# Laravel + Livewire

## Component architecture

- Keep Livewire components focused and small; extract domain logic to services/actions.
- Use Livewire for server-driven interactivity; avoid duplicating the same state logic in Alpine and Livewire.
- Prefer explicit component names and predictable public properties/actions.

## Validation and state

- Validate inputs at component/action boundaries (Form Requests or Livewire validation rules).
- Use loading/disabled states (`wire:loading`, `wire:target`) for async actions.
- Keep side effects explicit; avoid hidden state mutation across unrelated hooks.

## Security and rendering

- Authorize mutations with Policies/Gates in component actions.
- Treat component input as untrusted; sanitize/validate before persistence.
- Escape output by default in Blade; only render raw HTML when explicitly sanitized.

## Testing

- Add focused Livewire component tests for critical UI flows.
- Keep feature tests for end-to-end behavior across HTTP + Livewire boundaries.
