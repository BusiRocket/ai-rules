# Drupal Standards

## Platform constraints

- Target the project's Drupal major/minor support (Drupal 10/11 era projects).
- Follow project PHP constraints from `composer.json`.
- Keep dependencies Composer-managed.

## Drupal-native APIs first

- Prefer Entity API and Field API for content/domain data.
- Use Config API for configuration (avoid ad-hoc config stores).
- Use Cache API and cache metadata correctly (tags, contexts, max-age).
- Use Queue API for deferred/background work.
- Use logger channel services (`logger.factory`) for logs.

## Architecture

- Keep controllers/forms/plugins thin and focused.
- Move business and integration logic to services.
- Use plugin system for extensibility points.
- Prefix service/plugin IDs with module namespace.

## Dependency injection

- Register services in `MODULE.services.yml`.
- Prefer constructor injection.
- Avoid `\Drupal::service()` in new code except legacy glue boundaries.

## Data and schema

- Use Entity API when possible.
- For custom tables, define schema (`hook_schema`) and evolve with update hooks.
- Use Database API query builders/parameterized queries.

## Forms and security

- Use Form API validation/submit handlers.
- Keep state-changing operations permission-checked.
- Escape/sanitize output appropriately for render context.

## Testing

- Use Drupal testing layers (unit/kernel/functional) based on scope.
- Cover service logic and module integration boundaries.
