# React Performance

## Core approach

- Optimize for readability first; measure before tuning.
- Avoid premature memoization and abstraction.

## Memoization

- Use `useMemo` for expensive derived values.
- Use `useCallback` when stable function identity matters.
- Use `React.memo` only for components with stable props and demonstrated rerender pressure.

## JSX patterns

- Avoid inline handlers only when they cause meaningful rerender churn or break memoization.
- Prefer clarity when performance impact is negligible.

## Lists and keys

- Never use array index as key unless the list is static and order never changes.
