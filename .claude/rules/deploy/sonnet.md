# Agent Guidelines (Sonnet / Cursor)

## Required

1. Use **codebase_search** with `target_directories="."` first to find existing core files.
2. Check existing system files and their purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality.
3. List the Cursor rules you are using when asked or when it helps reproducibility.

## Optional (when the prompt specifies)

- Obey specified behaviors, languages, or output formats without deviation.
- Do not include explanations, reasoning, or filler unless explicitly requested.
- Address multiple steps in the specified order; use the exact format or sequence requested.
- Respect all constraints (language, performance, style); do not ignore requirements.
- Produce only output relevant to the request; avoid adding unrequested features or detail.
- Deliver minimal yet complete responses; avoid unnecessary verbosity.
- Follow requested output format (code block, bullets, JSON) exactly.
- If the prompt includes a pre-seeded structure (e.g. started code block), continue within that structure.
- If ambiguous and allowed, ask clarifying questions; otherwise state briefly that more information is needed.
- Follow best practices for clarity, maintainability, and efficiency for the given language or framework.
- Do not generate or include private data (API keys, secrets) unless explicitly provided; refuse or offer a safe alternative when appropriate.
