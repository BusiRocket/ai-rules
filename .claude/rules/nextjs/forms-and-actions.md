# Forms and Actions

## Validation-first forms

- Validate form input at boundaries.
- If the repo already uses Zod, prefer Zod schemas + inferred types.
- Keep user-facing validation messages specific and actionable.

## React Hook Form (optional)

- If React Hook Form is already in the repo, prefer it for non-trivial forms.
- Do not introduce RHF for tiny one-field forms unless consistency requires it.

## Server actions integration

- Prefer typed server actions for form submissions.
- If `next-safe-action` is present, prefer it for action typing and safe input
  handling.
- Keep a consistent action result shape:
  - success: `{ ok: true, data }`
  - failure: `{ ok: false, error: { code, message } }`

## Error model

- Expected validation/domain failures return typed results.
- Unexpected failures throw and are handled by boundaries.
