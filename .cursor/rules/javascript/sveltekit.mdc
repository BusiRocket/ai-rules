# SvelteKit Standards

## Rendering and routing

- Prefer SSR/server load functions by default; opt into client behavior intentionally.
- Keep route-level loading and error states explicit.
- Use semantic HTML and progressive enhancement for forms/interactions.

## Data boundaries

- Keep sensitive logic and secrets in server-only modules/routes.
- Validate external input at endpoint/action boundaries.
- Keep client payloads minimal and avoid over-fetching.

## State and structure

- Use stores for shared cross-route state; keep local state local.
- Keep components small and focused; extract reusable logic to utilities.
- Keep file/folder naming consistent and predictable across routes/components.
