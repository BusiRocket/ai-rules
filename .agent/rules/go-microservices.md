Description: Go microservices standards (clean architecture, resilience, observability)

# Go Microservices Standards

## Architecture

- Prefer clean architecture boundaries: transport -> use case -> repository -> domain.
- Keep framework details at the edges; keep domain logic framework-agnostic.
- Program to interfaces for dependencies and external boundaries.
- Prefer small, purpose-specific interfaces and explicit constructor injection.

## Code quality

- Keep functions short and single-purpose.
- Handle errors explicitly and wrap with context (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`).
- Avoid global mutable state; use dependency injection and config structs.
- Prefer composition over inheritance-style abstractions.

## Concurrency and context

- Propagate `context.Context` through request and downstream calls.
- Honor cancellation/timeouts on I/O boundaries.
- Use goroutines safely; protect shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- Ensure resources are closed deterministically (`defer`).

## Resilience and security

- Validate/sanitize external input at boundaries.
- Use timeouts, retries, and bounded backoff for external calls where safe.
- Add rate limiting/circuit breaking on abuse-prone or fragile boundaries.
- Keep authn/authz explicit and least-privilege by default.

## Observability

- Add structured logs with request/trace correlation ids.
- Instrument critical paths (HTTP/gRPC, DB, external APIs) with metrics/traces.
- Track core signals: latency, throughput, error rate, saturation.

## Testing and tooling

- Use table-driven unit tests and isolate external dependencies with mocks/fakes.
- Separate fast unit tests from integration/E2E suites.
- Enforce `go test`, `go fmt`, `goimports`, and `golangci-lint` in CI.
