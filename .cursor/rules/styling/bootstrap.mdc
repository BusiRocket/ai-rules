# Bootstrap Standards

## Layout and components

- Use Bootstrap grid (`container`, `row`, `col-*`) for responsive structure.
- Prefer Bootstrap components/utilities over large custom CSS overrides.
- Keep custom CSS minimal and focused on app-specific branding.
- Use semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA attributes for component accessibility.

## Forms and feedback

- Use Bootstrap validation classes for clear, immediate form feedback.
- Surface actionable errors with consistent alert/inline patterns.
- Ensure labels, help text, and error text are programmatically associated.

## Theming and customization

- Prefer Sass variables/mixins for theming instead of ad-hoc overrides.
- Keep style tokens centralized and consistent across components.

## Performance

- Include only required Bootstrap bundles/components when possible.
- Optimize assets (images/fonts/scripts) and avoid redundant UI libraries.
