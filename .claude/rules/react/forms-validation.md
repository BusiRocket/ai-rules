# Forms and Validation

## Validation baseline

- Use schema-based validation for external/user input boundaries.
- If Zod is present in the repo, prefer Zod schema + inferred types.
- Return clear, user-facing validation messages.

## React Hook Form (optional)

- If RHF is present in the project, prefer it for non-trivial forms.
- Do not force RHF for tiny forms where simple local state is clearer.

## Form architecture

- Keep field UI, schema, and submission flow coherent.
- Avoid duplicating validation logic between UI and boundary services.
