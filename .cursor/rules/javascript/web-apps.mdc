# Modern Web Apps

## Component behavior

- Prefer function components and declarative UI patterns.
- Keep side effects minimal and justified.
- Avoid inline handlers only when they reduce readability or create measurable
  rerender churn.

## Data boundaries

- Validate boundary input with schema/type guards.
- Normalize API errors into stable, typed shapes before UI consumption.

## Accessibility baseline

- Use semantic HTML first.
- Ensure keyboard operation and visible focus states for interactive elements.
- Add ARIA only where semantics are insufficient.

## Performance baseline

- Measure before tuning.
- Use memoization (`useMemo`/`useCallback`) only when beneficial.
