# Next.js + Supabase Standards

## Security and auth

- Keep service-role keys server-side only; never expose them to client bundles.
- Enforce Row Level Security (RLS) for user-scoped data access.
- Keep authorization checks server-side even if client guards exist.

## Data boundaries

- Encapsulate Supabase queries in service modules; keep UI/routes thin.
- Validate external input before writes/updates.
- Prefer typed query helpers/contracts to reduce runtime shape drift.

## Reliability and performance

- Keep auth/session flows explicit and resilient across SSR/client transitions.
- Use pagination and selective fields for large datasets.
- Add clear error mapping and user-friendly failure messages at boundaries.

## Realtime and storage

- Use realtime subscriptions intentionally; unsubscribe/cleanup to avoid leaks.
- Validate uploads and enforce storage access policies.
