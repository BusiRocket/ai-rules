# Refactor (@refactor / @file)

Use this rule by referencing **@refactor** or **@file** when you need to refactor the currently selected file.

## What to apply

- All quality criteria and extraction rules come from **code-quality-guidelines**: file size (10–50 target, ~100 max), one export per file, types in `types/<area>/`, no helpers inside components/hooks, constants in dedicated files, when to split, checklist.
- Do not duplicate those rules here; read and apply [code-quality-guidelines.mdc](.cursor/rules/core/code-quality-guidelines.mdc).

## Refactor workflow

1. **Scan** the file: identify responsibilities (UI, state/effects, pure helpers, types, large constants).
2. **Decide** what to extract using the heuristics and extraction decision tree in code-quality-guidelines (e.g. multiple functions → one per file; inline types → `types/<area>/`; complex logic → hook or util; repeated JSX → child components; large collections → constant files).
3. **Extract** and create/update files; fix all imports; remove unused code.
4. **Run** the project check script (e.g. `yarn check:all`, `npm run check`) and fix until clean.

## Mandatory after refactor

- Run the project's check script.
- Ensure the result satisfies the checklist in code-quality-guidelines.
