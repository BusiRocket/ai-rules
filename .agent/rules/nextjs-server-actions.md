# Server Actions Standards

## Goal

Keep server actions predictable, typed, and safe at boundaries.

## Validation

- Validate external input before business logic.
- If the repo already uses Zod, prefer Zod schemas + inferred types.
- Keep validation at the boundary; services enforce domain invariants.

## Expected vs unexpected failures

- Expected failures: return typed result objects.
- Unexpected failures: throw and let boundaries/error handling capture context.
- Do not rely on exception strings for control flow.

## Response shape (recommended)

Use a consistent action result shape:

- Success: `{ ok: true, data }`
- Failure: `{ ok: false, error: { code, message } }`

## next-safe-action (optional)

- If `next-safe-action` is already in the project, prefer it for typed server actions.
- Do not add it for trivial flows that are already safe and simple.
