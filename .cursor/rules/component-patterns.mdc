# React Component Patterns (strict)

## Component Organization
- **UI components** (`components/ui/`): primitive, reusable, no business logic (Button, Modal, Panel).
- **Feature components** (`components/<area>/`): organize by domain (app shell, feature-specific UI, shared).

## Component Guidelines
- Keep components small (<100 lines preferred, <200 max); extract sub-components when complexity grows.

## One Component Per File (STRICT)
- Exactly one exported component per `.tsx` file.
- No helper functions inside component files; extract to `utils/`.
- No inline types; import from `types/`.

## Client vs Server (App Router)
- Prefer Server Components by default.
- Add `'use client'` only when needed (state/effects/event handlers).

## Folder Namespacing
For complex components with children:
- `components/<area>/Parent/Parent.tsx`
- `components/<area>/Parent/Header.tsx`
- `components/<area>/Parent/Footer.tsx`

Avoid repeating the parent name in child filenames.
