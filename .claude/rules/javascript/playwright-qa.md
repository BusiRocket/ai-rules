# Playwright QA

## Test design

- Use isolated tests and deterministic fixtures.
- Prefer semantic locators: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`,
  `getByTestId`.
- Prefer `getBy*` and role-based locators over generic `page.locator(...)` selectors.
- Avoid fixed sleeps/timeouts; wait on explicit conditions.
- Prefer web-first assertions (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveText`, etc.) over manual waits.

## Maintainability

- Use helper utilities for repeated setup/flows.
- Use `test.beforeEach`/`test.afterEach` to enforce clean setup/teardown.
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure.
- Prioritize critical user journeys for coverage.
- Keep tests parallel-safe (no shared mutable test state).

## Reliability

- Keep assertions explicit and user-visible.
- Avoid brittle selectors tied to implementation details.
- Keep config concerns in `playwright.config.*` (projects/devices/baseURL/retries).
