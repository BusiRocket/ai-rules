# Security Baseline

## Input and output safety

- Treat external input as untrusted; validate and narrow at boundaries.
- Do not render untrusted HTML directly.

## XSS protections

- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless explicitly required.
- If raw HTML must be rendered, sanitize first with a reviewed sanitizer.

## Secrets and auth

- Never expose secrets to client bundles.
- Keep sensitive checks server-side even when client guards exist.
- Prefer least-privilege access patterns for roles/permissions.

## Logging

- Log actionable context, never secrets or personal tokens.
