# Staffbase – Platform Guidelines

Use this rule when working on projects that integrate with **Staffbase** (widgets, APIs/SDK, embedding in Staffbase apps).

## Platform context

- **Staffbase** provides employee apps and communication; projects often ship **widgets** that render inside Staffbase (e.g. Alerts widget, bulletins, custom UIs).
- Widgets integrate with **Staffbase APIs/SDK** and may run in **webviews** (including mobile iOS/Android).
- Build is typically **Vite** library mode → single **IIFE** bundle for embedding.

## Tech stack (typical)

- React 18, TypeScript, Vite/Webpack, Jest.
- Styling: **SCSS** with widget-scoped class prefixes (e.g. `example-widget-*`). Do not introduce Tailwind unless the project already uses it.
- MUI/Emotion where needed for richer UI.

## Build & bundle

- Vite library build → output in `dist/` (see `vite.config.ts`).
- Use `.env`, `.env.staging`, `.env.prod`, `.env.partner` (or equivalent) per environment; align with `package.json` scripts.
- Preferred checks: `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm format`, `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix`.

## Frontend runtime (critical)

- Widget code runs in the host app and in **mobile webviews** (iOS/Android).
- **Never reference Node globals** (e.g. `process`) at runtime; they can be bundled and cause `"process is not defined"` in browser/webview.
- Use **`import.meta.env`** (Vite) for environment variables and feature flags.
- Avoid patterns like `typeof process !== 'undefined'` in frontend code.

## Backend / Staffbase APIs and SDK

- Integrate with **Staffbase APIs/SDK** via a dedicated `services/` layer (e.g. `apiService`, `widgetService`).
- **Error handling**: robust handling for network failures and slow responses; surface user-friendly errors in the UI.
- Consider **retry/backoff** for idempotent operations only.
- **Security**: do not log sensitive data; validate and sanitize data from APIs.

## Source structure (Staffbase widgets)

- `src/components/` – TSX only; typical subfolders: `config/` (editor/config UI), `elements/` (presentational pieces), `views/` (runtime/editor views).
- `src/configuration/` – JSON schema, UI schema, and config helpers for widget configuration.
- `src/hooks/` – custom hooks (data fetching, widget logic).
- `src/services/` – API and Staffbase SDK access.
- `src/styles/` – shared styles (e.g. drawer, layout).
- `src/types/` – TypeScript types (with subfolders by domain).
- `src/utils/` – stateless utilities.

## Architecture

- **Separation of concerns**: component-based UI; business logic in hooks/services; clear boundaries.
- **Data flow**: unidirectional (parent → child); data fetching and shaping in hooks; callbacks for child → parent.
- **State**: React built-in (useState, useReducer); keep state close to usage; extract complex logic into custom hooks.
- **Performance**: lazy loading/pagination for lists; consider virtualization for large lists; memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback); debounce input-driven filters where appropriate.
- **Integration**: expose a clear API for embedding in Staffbase; use configuration props for customization; handle loading and error states in the UI.

## Styling

- Prefer **SCSS** and existing widget class prefixes; keep styles **scoped to the widget container** so they do not leak into the host page.
- Ensure sufficient **color contrast** and do not rely on color alone for meaning.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation and **ARIA** labeling in interactive components.
- Support screen readers and maintain focus management where relevant.

## Testing

- Jest + React Testing Library for components and hooks.
- **Mock Staffbase SDK and network calls** in tests.

## Error handling

- Wrap async flows in try/catch; surface user-friendly errors in the UI when possible.
- Avoid leaking stack traces or internal details to end users.
