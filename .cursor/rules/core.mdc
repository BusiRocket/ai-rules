# Core Rules (umbrella)

Use **@core** when you need the full set of core project rules in one go.

This rule references the following; for full detail open each:

- **Project & quality**: `.cursor/rules/core/project.mdc` — one-thing-per-file, check script
- **General**: `.cursor/rules/core/general.mdc` — agent defaults, code style, repo hygiene
- **Boundaries**: `.cursor/rules/core/boundaries.mdc` — where to put routes, components, hooks, utils, services, types
- **Naming & layout**: `.cursor/rules/core/naming-and-layout.mdc` — folder layout, file naming, exports
- **Anti-patterns**: `.cursor/rules/core/anti-patterns.mdc` — what to avoid (barrels, inline types, fat handlers)

## Short summary

- Many small files; one exported symbol per file; no inline types; no helpers inside components/hooks.
- Route handlers thin: validate → call service → return response.
- Run the project check script after meaningful changes.
