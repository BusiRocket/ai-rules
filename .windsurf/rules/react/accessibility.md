# Accessibility Baseline

## Semantics first

- Prefer semantic elements (`button`, `a`, `nav`, `main`, `header`, `section`) over generic `div` wrappers.
- Do not use a `div` as a button unless unavoidable.

## Keyboard and focus

- Interactive UI must be operable with keyboard.
- Preserve visible focus states; do not remove focus outlines without an accessible replacement.

## ARIA usage

- Add ARIA only when semantics are insufficient.
- Keep `aria-label`/`aria-describedby` aligned with visible intent.

## Forms

- Inputs need accessible labels.
- Validation and error messages must be programmatically associated with fields.

## Contrast

- Ensure text and interactive controls maintain accessible contrast in light and dark themes.
