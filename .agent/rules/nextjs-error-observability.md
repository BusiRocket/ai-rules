# Error Handling and Observability

## UI boundaries

- Use `error.tsx` for route-level failures.
- Use `global-error.tsx` for app-level unexpected failures.
- Keep fallback UI actionable and user-friendly.

## Expected vs unexpected errors

- Expected failures should return typed values where possible.
- Unexpected failures should throw and be captured by boundaries/logging.

## Logging

- Log errors with actionable context (operation, identifiers, boundary).
- Never log secrets, tokens, or sensitive personal data.

## Sentry (optional)

- If Sentry is already configured, use it for unexpected errors and key
  execution context.
- Do not add observability dependencies unless needed by the project.
