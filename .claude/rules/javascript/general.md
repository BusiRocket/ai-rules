# General JavaScript / TypeScript Standards

## Language defaults

- Prefer TypeScript for non-trivial changes.
- Prefer ES2022+ syntax and modern runtime APIs.
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when mutation is required.
- Prefer named exports over default exports unless framework conventions require
  otherwise.

## Style and naming

- Prefer guard clauses and early returns.
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (`isLoading`, `hasPermission`,
  `shouldRetry`).
- Keep modules small and focused.

## Architecture

- Prefer functional and declarative patterns.
- Avoid classes unless the runtime pattern strongly benefits from them.
- If classes are used, keep them small with narrow public APIs.

## Errors and logging

- Model expected failures as explicit result values where reasonable.
- Use `try/catch` for exceptional control flow and recovery boundaries.
- Log with actionable context, never secrets/tokens/PII.

## Security baseline

- Treat all external input as untrusted.
- Avoid unsafe execution APIs (`eval`, `new Function`) and unsanitized HTML
  rendering.
- Apply least privilege for permissions, data exposure, and API surface.
