# Django REST API Standards

## API design

- Follow RESTful semantics with clear method/status usage.
- Keep API versioning explicit and consistent (prefer URL-based versioning).
- Keep response contracts stable and documented.
- Use standardized success/error response shapes across endpoints.

## DRF layers

- Use serializers for validation + transformation, not just output formatting.
- Keep API views/viewsets focused on transport orchestration.
- Move domain rules to models/managers/services instead of bloating views.
- Use reusable permissions and validators for shared rules.

## Security

- Enforce authentication + authorization for every protected endpoint.
- Prefer framework-native auth stacks (Session/Auth headers/JWT libs already used).
- Validate/sanitize external input at boundaries; never trust client payloads.

## Performance and operability

- Apply pagination consistently for list endpoints.
- Prevent N+1 and monitor query counts in API hot paths.
- Use caching for expensive read paths with clear invalidation strategy.
- Add structured logs for request id, latency, status, and error context.

## Error handling

- Use centralized exception handling for predictable API error shape.
- Map validation/auth/domain errors to appropriate HTTP status codes.
