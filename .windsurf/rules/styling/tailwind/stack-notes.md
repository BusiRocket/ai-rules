# Tailwind Stack Notes

## React / Next

- Prefer utility composition in components and variant maps for reusable primitives.
- Use state variants (`aria-*`, `data-*`) for UI libraries that expose state attributes.

## Blade / Livewire

- Keep Tailwind in Blade/Livewire components; avoid inline style attributes.
- Prefer token utilities over ad-hoc colors.

## Ghost / Handlebars / Alpine

- Use utilities directly in templates and partial composition for reuse.
- Keep Alpine state small; avoid complex JS when semantic HTML can solve the interaction.
