# Vite Runtime Safety

## Goal

Prevent runtime crashes when the app or widget runs in the browser (e.g. Staffbase or other hosts). Node globals (`process`, `global`, `Buffer`) are often **not defined** in the browser.

## Rules

- **No Node globals at runtime**: Do not reference `process`, `global`, or `Buffer` in code that ships to the browser. Libraries may still pull them in.
- **If you see** `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined`: add a minimal shim early in the bundle (before other imports), e.g. a small `ensureProcessShim` (or equivalent) imported from entry and dev entry.
- **Environment variables**: Prefer compile-time replacements via Vite `define` (e.g. `import.meta.env.VITE_*`) for app configuration. Avoid dynamic env access patterns that the bundler cannot statically replace.

## Verification

- Run type-check and build (`yarn type-check`, `yarn build` or project equivalent).
- Load the built output in the real host and check the browser console for runtime errors.
