# Pest Grammar Guidance

## Scope

Use when editing `.pest` grammars or Rust parser code based on Pest.

## Rules

- Keep grammar changes small and focused; prefer minimal diffs.
- When debugging parse issues, point to the exact rule and propose 1-3 fixes.
- Use silent rules (`_ {}`) to reduce noisy parse trees when needed.
- Use atomic (`@{}`) or compound-atomic (`${}`) rules for ambiguity/perf hotspots.
- Keep rule ordering intentional (most-specific first).
- Add minimal parser tests (`parses_to!` or small `Parser::parse()` assertions).

## Pitfalls

- Missing `WHITESPACE`/`COMMENT` silent rules when grammar expects spacing/comments.
- Left-recursive or ambiguous patterns causing heavy backtracking.
