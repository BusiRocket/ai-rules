Description: HTMX standards (server-driven interactivity with minimal JS)

# HTMX Standards

## Interaction model

- Prefer declarative HTMX attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-put`, `hx-delete`) over custom JS when sufficient.
- Return minimal HTML fragments from server endpoints for targeted updates.
- Use `hx-target` and `hx-swap` intentionally to control DOM replacement semantics.
- Use `hx-trigger` explicitly for non-default interaction timing.

## UX and safety

- Keep server-side validation authoritative; client feedback should mirror server truth.
- Return proper HTTP status codes and clear error fragments for failed interactions.
- Use `hx-confirm` for destructive operations.
- Use `hx-push-url` only when the interaction meaningfully changes navigation state.

## Maintainability

- Keep fragment templates modular and reusable.
- Avoid coupling HTMX endpoints to full-page templates when fragment endpoints are sufficient.
- Document endpoint contract expectations (input, fragment output, error shape).

## Performance

- Keep fragment payloads small and cache where it helps.
- Avoid unnecessary full-region swaps when targeted updates are possible.
