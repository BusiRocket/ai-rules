# General PHP Standards

## Baseline

- Prefer PHP 8.3+ when stack constraints allow.
- Match project/platform constraints when a framework requires lower versions.
- Use PSR-12 unless the framework enforces a stricter variant.

## Language rules

- Use `declare(strict_types=1);` in owned PHP files where compatibility allows.
- Prefer typed properties, parameter/return types, readonly constructs, and `match` where appropriate.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid shared mutable static state.

## Architecture

- Keep controllers/endpoints/entrypoints thin.
- Place business rules in services/use-cases.
- Isolate infrastructure concerns (DB/HTTP/filesystem) behind explicit adapters/services.
- Use DI/service containers where available.

## Errors and logging

- Model expected failures as typed results or domain-level exceptions.
- Use `try/catch` only to recover, translate, or add context.
- Log actionable context (request/entity/user identifiers) without secrets.

## Security (mandatory)

- Validate external input first, sanitize/normalize where needed, escape at output.
- Use parameterized queries and framework DB abstractions.
- Treat HTTP, CLI args, webhook payloads, and imported data as untrusted.
- Avoid unsafe unserialize, dynamic includes, and shell execution without strict controls.

## Testing

- Unit tests for business logic/services.
- Integration tests for DB/HTTP/framework boundaries.
- Prefer fixtures/factories over coupling to production-like data dumps.
