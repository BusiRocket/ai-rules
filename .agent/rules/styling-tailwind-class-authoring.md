Description: Tailwind class authoring conventions (ordering, variants, readability)

# Tailwind Class Authoring

- Keep class lists readable and stable.
- Use this order when possible:
  - layout/display -> positioning -> sizing -> spacing -> typography -> colors -> border/radius -> effects -> motion -> state.
- If a component repeatedly needs 20+ utilities:
  - extract a wrapper component or variant map.
- Prefer `cn()` + variant maps (CVA if already present) over inline conditional class spaghetti.
- Avoid creating custom CSS utility layers that duplicate Tailwind.
