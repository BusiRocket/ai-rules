# Stripe Subscriptions Standards

## Core flows

- Keep checkout/subscription creation server-side.
- Use Stripe Customer Portal for subscription self-management when suitable.
- Keep subscription state synchronized with application user/account records.

## Webhooks

- Verify webhook signatures before processing events.
- Make webhook handlers idempotent and retry-safe.
- Handle key subscription events (`created`, `updated`, `deleted`, invoice outcomes).

## Security and reliability

- Store Stripe secrets in secure env vars only.
- Never trust client-reported payment state; trust Stripe events/server checks.
- Log actionable billing context without leaking sensitive payment data.

## Data consistency

- Use transactions/locking where needed to prevent duplicate or conflicting updates.
- Keep a clear mapping model: app user <-> Stripe customer <-> active subscriptions.
