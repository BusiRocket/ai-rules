# Rust Lint Triage

## Goal

Decide whether a lint is valid, likely false-positive, or uncertain.

## Workflow

1. Capture lint name, location, message, and local snippet.
2. Trace related moves/borrows/clones across nearby scopes.
3. Check missing imports/traits and macro expansion context.
4. Classify: valid, likely false-positive, or uncertain.
5. Recommend action:
   - refactor to satisfy lint
   - local `#[allow(...)]` with justification
   - global allow only with strong project-level reason

## Notes

- Prefer fixing root causes over suppressing lints.
- Keep suppressions narrow and documented.
