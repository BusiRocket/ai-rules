# Rendering and Performance

## Rendering model

- Prefer Server Components by default.
- Add `'use client'` only for interactivity, browser APIs, or client-only
  libraries.
- Keep client islands small and focused.

## Dynamic imports

- Use `dynamic()` + Suspense for non-critical client features that benefit from
  split loading.
- Do not add dynamic boundaries when they increase complexity without measurable
  benefit.

## Images and scripts

- Use `<Image />` with explicit dimensions or `fill`.
- Lazy-load non-critical images.
- Use `<Script />` only when third-party scripts are required.

## Web Vitals focus

- Optimize LCP, CLS, and INP for user-visible pages.
- Prefer changes that improve default rendering and payload size before
  introducing micro-optimizations.
