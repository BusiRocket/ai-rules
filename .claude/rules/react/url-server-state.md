# URL State and Server State

## Priority order

- Prefer Server Components and server-side fetch/caching first.
- Use client-side server state only when interaction requires it.

## URL search params

- If the repo already uses `nuqs`, prefer `nuqs` for URL param state.
- Avoid ad-hoc parsing spread across components.

## Client server state

- Use TanStack Query only for cases that benefit from client cache/sync behavior.
- Do not introduce query libraries for static or purely server-rendered flows.

## Local vs global

- Prefer local component state and composition first.
- Promote to store/query only when shared behavior or cache lifecycle is truly needed.
