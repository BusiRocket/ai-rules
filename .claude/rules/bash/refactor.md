# @file Bash Refactor Workflow

Use this rule by referencing **@file** on a Bash script. Apply the following steps to the selected file.

## Goals

- Make the script small, readable, and single-responsibility.
- Keep the **entry script filename unchanged** so external/server calls keep working.
- Move reusable logic into `utils/` (and area subfolders) as separate `.sh` files.
- Prefer one logical entry function per file; extract additional helpers to dedicated files.
- After edits, validate with `bash -n` and, when possible, `shellcheck`.

## Algorithm

1. **Scan** — Identify responsibilities: CLI entry (args/env + usage), I/O boundaries (fs, network, DB), pure helpers.
2. **Decide** — Keep CLI parsing + top-level orchestration in the entry script; move shared helpers to `scripts/bash/utils/*.sh` or `scripts/bash/<area>/utils/*.sh`; keep files small.
3. **Wire** — Add `source "$(dirname "$0")/relative/path/to/helper.sh"` at the top; replace inlined functions with calls to imported helpers.
4. **Safety** — Preserve script interface (arguments, env vars, exit codes). Do not change entry script filename or shebang.
5. **Validate** — Run `bash -n <script>`; prefer existing integration flows (cron/CI) where feasible.

## Acceptance Criteria

- File responsibilities are clear and minimal.
- Entry scripts are thin: mostly argument parsing + one main function call.
- Shared helpers live in `scripts/bash/utils/` (and area subfolders when needed).
- No changes to entry script filenames; paths compatible with existing server calls.
- No syntax errors (`bash -n` clean) and no new `shellcheck` warnings where used.
