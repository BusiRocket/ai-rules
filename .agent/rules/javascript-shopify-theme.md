# Shopify Theme JavaScript (OS 2.0)

## Rendering strategy

- Prefer Liquid/server-rendered HTML first.
- For UI updates, prefer fetching server-rendered fragments over heavy client
  state where possible.

## Dependency strategy

- Keep dependencies minimal; prefer browser-native primitives first.
- Introduce dependencies only when complexity justifies long-term maintenance
  cost.

## Module pattern

- Use module-scoped functions to avoid global leakage.
- If classes are used for theme modules, keep them small with minimal public
  API and private internals.

## DOM and security

- Treat theme settings and merchant input as untrusted content.
- Avoid unsanitized HTML insertion patterns.
- Preserve focus and keyboard accessibility in interactive components.
