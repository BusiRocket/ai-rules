# Turbo Monorepo Standards

## Boundaries

- Keep app-specific code in `apps/*`; move reusable code to `packages/*`.
- Avoid importing app internals from other apps directly.
- Publish shared contracts/types from packages instead of duplicating.

## Pipeline and tasks

- Keep Turbo tasks deterministic and side-effect aware for caching.
- Ensure task inputs/outputs are declared correctly for reliable remote/local cache hits.
- Prefer shared scripts/config at workspace root when behavior is common.

## Dependency hygiene

- Keep package dependencies explicit; avoid hidden transitive reliance.
- Version-lock critical toolchain dependencies for reproducible CI.
- Add lightweight package-level checks/tests where they prevent regressions early.
