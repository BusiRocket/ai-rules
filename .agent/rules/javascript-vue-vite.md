# Vue + Vite Standards

## Component and state model

- Use Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for Vue components.
- Keep components focused; move shared logic to composables/utilities.
- Use Pinia for shared client state; keep local state local.
- Prefer explicit typed props/emits and avoid implicit `any` data flow.

## Routing and data

- Keep route modules organized and lazy-load heavy route chunks.
- Keep data-fetching concerns separate from presentational components.
- Use validation at boundaries and normalize API errors before UI consumption.

## UI and performance

- Use utility-first styling consistently (Tailwind + chosen component libs).
- Use async components/Suspense for non-critical UI sections when beneficial.
- Optimize Vite chunking/code-splitting intentionally; avoid giant vendor bundles.
- Prefer semantic HTML and keyboard-accessible interactions.
