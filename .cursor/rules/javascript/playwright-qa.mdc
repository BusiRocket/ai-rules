# Playwright QA

## Test design

- Use isolated tests and deterministic fixtures.
- Prefer semantic locators: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`,
  `getByTestId`.
- Avoid fixed sleeps/timeouts; wait on explicit conditions.

## Maintainability

- Use helper utilities for repeated setup/flows.
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert structure.
- Prioritize critical user journeys for coverage.

## Reliability

- Keep assertions explicit and user-visible.
- Avoid brittle selectors tied to implementation details.
