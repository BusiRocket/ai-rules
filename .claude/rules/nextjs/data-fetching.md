# Data Fetching Strategy

## Defaults

- Prefer server-side fetching in Server Components, route handlers, or server
  actions.
- Avoid client-side fetching for data that can be rendered on the server.

## Waterfall prevention

- Start independent async work early and resolve in parallel with
  `Promise.all`.
- Avoid sequential awaits when data sources do not depend on each other.
- Consider preload patterns only when they clearly reduce latency.

## Caching intent

- Decide caching behavior intentionally for each flow.
- Avoid accidental stale UI by documenting if a route is dynamic, revalidated,
  or fully static.
- Keep cache logic out of UI components when possible.

## Client cache usage

- Use TanStack Query only when client cache/sync/optimistic updates are
  required.
- Do not add query state layers to simple server-rendered flows.
