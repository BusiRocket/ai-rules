# Laravel Standards

## Platform constraints

- Prefer current stable Laravel major supported by the project (Laravel 12+ in modern projects).
- Prefer PHP 8.2+ (8.3+ when compatible with dependencies and hosting).

## Architecture

- Controllers should be thin orchestration layers.
- Keep business logic in services/actions/domain classes.
- Use constructor DI/method injection over static facades in core business paths.
- Use repositories only when persistence complexity justifies the extra layer.
- Keep controllers and services cohesive; split classes that accumulate unrelated responsibilities.

## Framework-native primitives

- Validation: Form Requests.
- Authorization: Policies/Gates.
- Background jobs: Queues/Jobs (Horizon when available).
- Response shaping: API Resources.
- Decoupling: Events/Listeners where useful.

## Data and persistence

- Use Eloquent for standard CRUD and relationships.
- Use Query Builder when complex SQL is clearer than Eloquent chains.
- Use `DB::transaction()` for multi-step data integrity.
- Keep migrations reversible and indexed intentionally.
- Use pagination helpers for list endpoints (`paginate`, `cursorPaginate`) instead of ad-hoc paging.

## API and contracts

- For public APIs, define explicit versioning strategy (path/header) and keep it consistent.
- Use API Resources/Transformers as the boundary contract; avoid leaking internal model structure.
- Normalize expected failures to stable response shapes and status codes.

## Performance and operations

- Use caching intentionally (`Cache::remember`, tags/locks where appropriate); document invalidation strategy.
- Move long-running or retryable work to jobs/queues; keep web requests fast.
- Use Scheduler for recurring tasks; keep schedule definitions deterministic and observable.
- Favor eager loading and query profiling to avoid N+1 issues.

## Security and reliability

- Keep CSRF enabled for state-changing web flows.
- Rate-limit public endpoints where abuse is possible.
- Never expose secrets in responses/logs.
- Use signed URLs for sensitive temporary links where appropriate.
- Prefer built-in auth/authz primitives (Sanctum/Passport/Policies/Gates) over custom security plumbing.

## Conventions

- Follow Laravel naming conventions: singular Models (e.g. `User`), intent-based controllers (e.g. `UserController`).
- Use `snake_case` for DB columns and config keys; follow project convention for PHP variables/methods.
- Preserve existing PHPDoc/comments unless they are inaccurate; update instead of deleting by default.

## Testing

- Unit + feature tests with PHPUnit/Pest.
- Use factories and isolated test databases.
- Add browser/E2E tests only for critical end-user flows.
