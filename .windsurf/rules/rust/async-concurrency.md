# Rust Async and Concurrency

## Runtime and task model

- Prefer `tokio` runtime for async I/O and structured task orchestration.
- Use `async fn` for async boundaries and explicit return types.
- Use `tokio::spawn` for concurrent units with clear ownership and cancellation paths.
- Use `tokio::select!` to coordinate cancellation, timeout, and competing async branches.

## Channels and synchronization

- Prefer bounded channels for backpressure (`mpsc`, `broadcast`, `oneshot` as needed).
- Handle full-channel/drop scenarios explicitly; do not ignore send failures.
- Use `tokio::sync::Mutex`/`RwLock` sparingly; keep lock scopes short and never hold across expensive `.await` sections.

## Reliability

- Add timeouts for external calls and long-running async operations.
- Use retries with bounded backoff for transient failures only.
- Avoid blocking inside async tasks; offload blocking work via `spawn_blocking`.

## Errors and testing

- Use `Result`/`Option` idiomatically and propagate context-rich errors.
- Prefer typed errors (`thiserror`) or contextual wrappers (`anyhow`) based on layer boundaries.
- Use `#[tokio::test]` for async tests and `tokio::time::pause` for deterministic time-based tests.
