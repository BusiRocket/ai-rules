# Laravel + Vue

## Boundary design

- Keep backend/frontend boundary explicit: controllers/resources define stable contracts.
- Prefer API Resources (or Inertia props contracts) over ad-hoc array payloads.
- Version public API contracts when backward compatibility matters.

## Frontend integration

- Keep Vue components presentational when possible; move data orchestration to composables/stores.
- Avoid duplicating validation rules inconsistently between frontend and backend.
- Use route-level code splitting and lazy loading for heavy pages/features.

## Security and auth

- Keep sensitive checks on server-side policies/gates.
- Use Laravel auth stack consistently (Sanctum/Passport/session) and avoid custom token flows unless justified.
- Keep CSRF protection enabled for state-changing flows.

## Data and performance

- Prevent N+1 on backend and over-fetching on frontend.
- Cache expensive backend queries intentionally and document invalidation.
- Paginate large collections and stream/chunk heavy exports/jobs.
