# Bash/Shell Standards

## Language & Style

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env -S bash` or `#!/bin/bash` consistently at the top of executables.
- Enable strict mode in non-trivial scripts: `set -euo pipefail`; use `IFS=$'\n\t'` when safe.
- Use lowercase snake_case for function names; UPPER_CASE for constants and env vars.
- Prefer long flags (`--help`) over short ones when available.
- Comments focused on "why" more than "what".

## Modules & Structure

- Keep files **single-responsibility and small**; extract helpers proactively.
- **One responsibility per script file**: CLI entry scripts parse args/env and call helpers; helpers live in `utils/` or area subfolders.
- Do not rename entry scripts invoked from server/cron; move logic into `scripts/<area>/utils/*.sh` and have the entry script `source` and call one entry function.
- Use `source "$(dirname "$0")/relative/path/to/helper.sh"` so paths work regardless of CWD.

## Functions

- Prefer small, focused functions; avoid multiple unrelated functions in the same file.
- Reuse existing helpers; extend with parameters rather than duplicating.
- Validate input parameters early; exit with a clear message on invalid input.

## IO & Errors

- Use explicit non-zero exit codes on failure (`exit 1`, `exit 2`, etc. with meaning).
- Print machine-friendly logs by default; avoid excessive noise in cron jobs.
- Send errors to stderr (`echo "message" >&2`). Never echo secrets to output.

## Layout (suggested)

- Top-level executable scripts (names unchanged for compatibility).
- `scripts/bash/utils/*.sh` — shared helpers (logging, color output, common helpers).
- `scripts/bash/<area>/*.sh` — area-specific helpers when needed.

## Validation

- Prefer running `shellcheck` on new or modified scripts where possible.
- Keep POSIX vs bash-specific constructs consistent with the shebang.

## Naming (DevOps / automation)

- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions; use `snake_case` for file and directory names.
- UPPER_CASE for environment variables.
- Avoid hard-coded values; use environment variables or config files.
- Principle of least privilege for access and permissions.
- Use `trap` for error handling and cleaning up temporary files.
- Redirect output to log files where appropriate; separate stdout and stderr.
